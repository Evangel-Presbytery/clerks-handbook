The prophet Isaiah gives us a glimpse of the importance of this in the church:\n\n\nWoe to those who enact evil statutes\nAnd to those who constantly record unjust decisions,\nSo as to deprive the needy of justice\nAnd rob the poor of My people of their rights,\nSo that widows may be their spoil\nAnd that they may plunder the orphans.\n(Isaiah 10:1)\n\n\nGod cares about the records we keep. The recording of truth helps ensure that the poor and the needy are well cared for in the church.",

Each of these courts must have a stated clerk who is officially responsible for its records. The presbytery as a whole has a stated clerk, and each church session is responsible for electing its own stated clerk (BCO 6.3), often referred to as the “clerk of session”; he is responsible for keeping, organizing, understanding, and furnishing the church’s records:\n\nIt is the duty of the Clerk, besides recording the transactions, to preserve the records carefully, and to grant extracts from them whenever properly required. Such extracts, under the hand of the Clerk, shall be evidence to any ecclesiastical court, and to every part of the Church. (BCO 12.4)",

In particular, the task of keeping minutes is often delegated to a recording clerk, or clerk pro tempore (clerk pro tem for short), as it can be difficult to participate in a meeting while also recording the meeting’s proceedings.\nThe clerk will also often utilize other individuals in keeping records for committees, subcommittees, or other boards of the church. For instance, the clerk should normally rely on the secretary of the board of deacons to keep good records for the deacons.\nEven when help from others is utilized, the stated clerk is still finally responsible for compiling the records kept, and for ensuring their accuracy.",

They are the official record of the decisions of a deliberative body. Once approved, they are the final word on what happened and what was decided at a meeting. Good minutes help promote integrity and accountability, and they act as a practical reference for future discussions and decisions of the session.

Will he have enough information to clearly understand what decision was made, who was involved, and why the decision was made? For example, use full names of individuals (i.e., not just first names) and organizations (i.e., not just abbreviations) at least the first time they appear in each set of minutes.\n\n\n2. Concision\nMinutes are intended to record essential information only. They should not be a detailed play-by-play of deliberation. The most important thing to record in minutes is any official action taken by the session. For example, it is not necessary to record every amendment that is made to a motion before it is finally voted on and approved; it is only necessary to record the motion in its final form. (For more information on recording motions in the minutes, see [Recording Motions] in the chapter on [Robert’s Rules of Order for Clerks].)\n\n\n3. Consistency\nThere are many different ways to approach spelling, punctuation, abbreviations, outline structure, etc. The most important thing is to be consistent in how you handle such matters of formatting and style. Consistency helps minutes to be more clear, and it makes minutes more useful as a reference. For example, it is common to use a computer program to search the minutes for all mentions of a particular name. Being careful to spell names correctly and consistently helps ensure that you will be able to find the information you need.",

It shall keep a full record of its proceedings, which shall be submitted to the court appointing it, entered on its minutes, and regarded and treated as the action of the court” (BCO 17.1).\nThe board of deacons. While deacons’ minutes do not need to be submitted to the presbytery for review, they do need to be submitted to the session (BCO 11.4). The clerk of session will most often rely on the secretary of the board of deacons to keep minutes for deacons meetings, but it is still the clerk’s responsibility to ensure these minutes are accurate, well organized, and available for review.\nThe congregation. Because of the size of the body meeting, congregational meetings are often more formal in their proceedings than session meetings. Minutes for congregational meetings are just as important as session meetings and should adhere to the same principles as session minutes.\n\nA church may have many committees that meet regularly, and those committees may choose to take minutes. However, it is not necessary for the clerk of session to have a permanent record of all committees’ minutes.",

After taking minutes…\n\nEdit and proofread the minutes shortly after the meeting.\nSend edited minutes to the moderator for review and correction. It is good for the clerk to work hard to understand the personality, working habits, and preferences of the moderator, so as to ensure the effectiveness of his leadership of the session. In general, the stated clerk should seek to accomplish any minutes-related tasks which are most helpful to the moderator. For example, it may be helpful for the clerk to make a practice of reminding session members of their assigned action items between meetings.\nSend moderator-reviewed minutes to session members for review before the meeting at which they will be adopted. Provide sufficient time for review. Avoid sending minutes out the day of the meeting where they are to be adopted. It is best to give a few days or a week for session members to review minutes and to provide you with any additional corrections prior to the meeting where they are to be adopted. When exactly you send minutes may depend on the preferences of the members and/or the moderator of your particular session.\nProvide a copy of the reviewed minutes to the session at the meeting where they are to be adopted.\nHelp ensure that the session votes to adopt the reviewed minutes. This most often happens at the beginning of a session meeting. It may occasionally happen via email.\nFile newly adopted minutes with the permanent record of minutes immediately after the meeting where they are officially adopted. For good filing practices, see [Organization of Records].\n\nThe same process outlined above can be used by the session to review and approve congregational meeting minutes as well.",

If a session is unable to try the person or persons accused, then the presbytery has the right of jurisdiction.\n\n\n5.3.2 Offenses\nAs stated in BCO 32.1,\n\nAn offense, the proper object of judicial process, is anything in the principles or practice of a church member professing faith in Christ, which is contrary to the Word of God.\n\n\n\n5.3.3 Church Censures\nThe censures which may be inflicted by church courts are:\n\nadmonition,\nsuspension from the Sacraments,\nsuspension from office,\ndeposition from office, and\nexcommunication.\n\nFor more information, see BCO 33, 39, and 40.",

    "text": "7.4 After Review\nAfter the Sessional Records Committee has reviewed your records, they will return them to you with comments.\n\n7.4.1 Types of Exception\nComments from the SRC will generally be to indicate “exceptions,” of which there are three types:\n\nNotations, defined in Evangel’s bylaws as “typographical errors, misspellings, improper punctuation, and other minor variations in form and clarity” (6(D)(6)).\nExceptions of Form, defined in Evangel’s bylaws as “violations of Evangel Presbytery’s Guidelines for Keeping Session Minutes or violations of rules of order” (ibid.).\nExceptions of Substance, defined in Evangel’s bylaws as “apparent violations of the Scripture or serious irregularities from the Constitution of Evangel Presbytery, actions out of accord with the deliverances of the Presbytery, and matters of impropriety and important delinquencies” (ibid.).\n\n\n\n7.4.2 Correcting Exceptions\n\nNotations, whenever possible, should be corrected in the minutes. Such corrections typically do not require review or action by the session, since they are usually typographical in nature and therefore do not affect the meaning of what was recorded.\nExceptions of form should also be corrected in the minutes when possible. These corrections may sometimes require review and action from the board, especially if the corrections will substantially change the meaning of something which was recorded in the minutes. Use discretion.\nExceptions of substance are referred by the SRC to the presbytery so that the presbytery as a whole can decide how to address the error, and whether to pursue a more formal process of discipline. Exceptions of substance must be corrected by the session, unless the session can demonstrate that the exception of substance was given in error. See section 6 of Evangel’s bylaws for more information.\n\n\n\n7.4.3 When Not to Correct Minutes\nWhen an exception of form or an exception of substance results from an error on the part of the session, and the minutes accurately record the session’s error, there is nothing to correct in the minutes. Depending on the circumstances, official action on the part of the session may be required to correct its error, but that might not always be possible. For example, if a session failed to give the congregation adequate notice about a congregational meeting, and yet the meeting still took place, this would be an exception of form, but the session cannot go back and undo the violation of good order. An exception of form from the SRC in this case is a reminder to the session to make sure that it does its work properly in the future. (In cases where good order has been violated, it is often prudent for the session to acknowledge its failure to at least those directly affected by the violation. Furthermore, it is wise to record such an acknowledgment in the minutes.)\n\n\n7.4.4 Apparent Violations\nAt other times, the minutes, due to a lack of clarity, might indicate an apparent exception where no violation was actually committed by the session. If this is the case, the SRC will typically recommend clarifying the minutes so that they more accurately reflect what happened. It’s ultimately up to the session to decide whether to correct its minutes in this case, but the session should understand that leaving the records unclear may result in problems for itself down the road. Since this kind of error is usually more than just typographical, it is a good idea for the session to formally adopt an amendment to its previously approved minutes.\n\n\n7.4.5 Recommendations\nThe SRC will sometimes provide recommendations on how you can improve the clarity, concision, or consistency of your minutes. These are merely recommendations and do not require correction. They are offered as an aid to making your minutes more useful to your own session.",

This is best accomplished by preserving the will of the majority while also preserving the voice of the minority.\nThis chapter is a mix of Robert’s Rules and general advice regarding good order.

    "text": "Adjournment – This means ending the meeting, but technically with the intention of reconvening as a body at a later time. A motion to adjourn requires a set time you’re adjourning to, most likely the next meeting. If the session has a regular meeting schedule, it is implied that the motion to adjourn is proposing adjournment to the next regular scheduled meeting. (See Motion to Adjourn below.)\nCall the Question – If successful, a motion to call the question puts an end to debate and causes an immediate vote on the motion being discussed. Also called “Previous Question” (see RONR 16:1).\nConsensus – This is the generally expressed will of the session, and can be used to take official action. Which is to say, not every action requires the formality of M/S/A.\nM/S/A, i.e., Moved, Seconded, Approved – This tends to be the most frequent application of Robert’s Rules in session meetings. The normal process is for a member of the session to move that the board take some action. The motion then requires a second from another member of the session (but see Small Boards below); only after a second can the motion be discussed. After discussion (if there is any), the session votes on whether or not to approve the motion.\nOrders of the Day – This helps ensure that agenda items that are pre-agreed on happen at a certain time. It is commonly used to set a standard meeting end time. If an end time has been set, and that time is reached, a member may move to extend orders of the day by a certain amount of time in order for discussion to continue (see RONR 41:41; see also Orders of the Day below.)\nQuorum – A quorum is the minimum number of members who must be present in order to conduct business (RONR 3:3).

    "title": "8  Robert’s Rules of Order for Clerks",
    "section": "8.2 Handling Common Situations",
    "text": "8.2 Handling Common Situations\n\n8.2.1 Following the Agenda\nAn agenda exists for the purpose of disciplining a board to stay on task. If there is an agenda that determines what business is in order for the meeting, that agenda must be approved by the board (typically at the beginning of the meeting) in order to be binding (RONR 41:61–62). Members of the board generally have the privilege of introducing new items of business during the “New Business” section of a meeting (RONR 41:27).\n\n\n8.2.2 Recording Motions\nAs clerk you are responsible to record motions in the minutes. Sometimes it can be a challenge to know exactly what the motion is, especially if there has been extended discussion about the motion. The clerk must pay close attention, and he is often looked to as the source for the current state of the motion. Feel free to speak up and ask for clarification (but avoid dominating the discussion with requests for clarifications). It is always a good idea to read a motion before proceeding to a vote. The importance of doing so is heightened by the length of discussion, as well as the gravity, complexity, and nuance of the motion being voted on. (For general information on keeping good minutes, see [Keeping Minutes].)\n\nAmended Motions\nMotions will often be amended before they are finally voted on. This commonly takes place in the following order of events:\n\nMember A makes a motion.\nMember B seconds Member A’s motion.\nThe session discusses Member A’s motion.\n\nMember C makes a motion to amend Member A’s motion.\nMember D seconds Member C’s motion to amend Member A’s motion. (If there is general consensus that the amendment enhances the original motion, the amendment can be considered a “friendly amendment,” and the session can skip to the final step of approving the original motion, as amended, without having to formally vote on the amendment.)\nThe session discusses Member C’s proposed amendment to Member A’s motion.\nThe session votes on Member C’s amendment to Member A’s motion.\n\nIf necessary, the session continues to discuss Member A’s motion (as amended, if the amendment was approved).\nThe session votes on Member A’s motion (as amended, if the amendment was approved).\n\nFor amended motions, you almost never need to record the original version of the motion in the minutes. You just record the version you ended up with and which was finally voted on. Then, if it is approved, you record, “Approved as amended.” (See RONR 48:4(6)(a); see 48:8 for an example.)\nOccasionally, the elders board may have a motion with an amendment (and possibly an amendment of the amendment) pending, and the board decides that it no longer wants to deal with the main motion or its amendments. In this case a motion is in order to “postpone to a definite time” (say, the next session meeting) or to “postpone indefinitely.” If such a motion is approved, it dismisses the previous main motion and all of its pending amendments with that one vote. In such a case, the minutes will need to record the current state of the motion and all pending amendments (RONR 48:4(6)(b)). This is one of the only times you ever need to record the contents of amendments and something other than the final version of a motion in the minutes.\n\n\n\n8.2.3 Approval of Minutes\nMinutes of past meetings must be approved by the board. If you keep up with this, at each meeting you will be approving just the minutes of the most recent past meeting. Note that “A formal motion to approve the minutes is not necessary, although such a motion is not out of order” (RONR 41:10). Minutes are often simply approved by consensus. For a recommended approval process, see [Adoption Process for Session Minutes].\n\n\n8.2.4 Orders of the Day\nAs stated above, some boards have a standard ending time for their meetings. This is called “orders of the day” (RONR 41:41). It may fall to you as the clerk to help the session conduct its business within its own agreed-upon time limits. However, it is important that you do so while being sensitive to the conversation that’s going on, and that you wait for an appropriate moment to bring up orders of the day. That moment is probably not the very moment the clock strikes 9 p.m.\n\n\n8.2.5 Motion to Adjourn\nThe moderator should generally ask for a motion to adjourn rather than simply adjourning the meeting on his own authority (see RONR 21:14–15). Asking for a motion to adjourn gives anyone who needs to a chance to bring up important business before the meeting is over. A motion to adjourn is not debatable or amendable; if the body doesn’t want to adjourn, the motion simply gets voted down and you proceed with business.",

    "text": "8.3 Robert’s Rules Was Made for Man, and Not Man for Robert’s Rules\nRemember that Robert’s Rules of Order is intended to enhance and not to hamper the work of a deliberative body. Here are some liberating provisions straight from Robert’s Rules which you might not know about:\n\n8.3.1 Small Boards\nRobert’s Rules explicitly calls for less formality when the size of the board is small:\n\nIn a board meeting where there are not more than about a dozen members present, some of the formality that is necessary in a large assembly would hinder business. The rules governing such meetings are different from the rules that hold in other assemblies… (RONR 49:21)\n\nFor instance:\n\nMotions do not need a second (though see below about custom).\nInformally discussing subjects is allowable when there’s not a motion currently pending.\nThe moderator can participate in debates and in informal discussions and can vote on matters (unless your bylaws specify that he doesn’t have a vote)—all without leaving the chair (i.e., without temporarily stepping down as moderator as you do in a large assembly).\n\nSee RONR 49:21 for more information.\n\n\n8.3.2 Custom\nIt is not against Robert’s Rules for a board to have its own customs. After all, Robert’s Rules itself is just a commonly accepted custom which a board may opt to follow.\n\nIn some organizations, a particular practice may sometimes come to be followed as a matter of established custom so that it is treated practically as if it were prescribed by a rule. If there is no contrary provision in the parliamentary authority or written rules of the organization, such an established custom is adhered to unless the assembly, by majority vote, agrees in a particular instance to do otherwise. (RONR 2:25)\n\nFor example, a small board might by custom require a second on formal motions. There may be no need to have this custom written down. You simply observe it.\nWhen a custom is called into question, it may sometimes make sense to take a vote on it that’s then entered into the minutes and documented as a decision of the board.",

    "text": "8.4 Congregational Meetings\nMany of the above principles for good order apply equally to congregational meetings. However, congregational meetings are necessarily more formal than session meetings because they involve more people. For instance, informal discussion, while appropriate in many session meetings, is almost always unhelpful in the context of a congregational meeting.\nHere are some questions regarding congregational meetings to make sure you know the answers to:\n\nWho’s the clerk? Depending on your church bylaws, you may automatically be the clerk of congregational meetings by virtue of being the clerk of session; or a clerk may need to be elected. Know your bylaws and help the moderator know what is supposed to be done.\nWho takes minutes? The clerk is responsible for taking minutes for the congregational meeting. For more information on who takes minutes, see [The Clerk’s Help].\nWhat’s a quorum? The clerk of the meeting will need to establish a quorum in order for business to be conducted at the meeting. Consult your church bylaws beforehand to know how many members constitute a quorum.\nWhat about ballots? If your church bylaws call for voting by secret ballot, ensure that such ballots are prepared for the meeting. Also make sure there’s a process in place for collecting and counting ballots.\nWhat constitutes a majority? Know what your bylaws require in order for a vote to pass. In some cases, a supermajority, i.e., more than a 50%-plus-1 majority, is required to take action, especially on significant matters like amending the church’s constitution. Also know what your bylaws say about whether the majority required is a majority of all members, a majority of those present at a meeting, or a majority of the votes cast. The last is the most common and is recommended for most procedures.",
