# Submission of Records to Presbytery

**Assignment: Alex**

NOTE FROM LUCAS: I think church budgets should simply be added to this section, and removed as a stand-alone section. the only reason why clerks need to concern themselves with church budgets is so that they can submit them to the presbytery each year.

Getting your minutes into PDFâ€¦

1. Copy and paste all minutes into a singular Word document.
