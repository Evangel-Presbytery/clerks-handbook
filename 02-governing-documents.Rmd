# Governing Documents

Need to discuss:

* Civil documents
* Church documents
* Relationship between church bylaws and the BCO
  * bylaws are in addition to the BCO and are subordinate to it.
  * May be worth mentioning kinds of areas where a church may be more specific: voting age, officer terms, etc.
