<span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Types of membership<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#types-of-membership"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Church membership in congregations of Evangel Presbytery consists of two types: communicant and non-communicant membership. The former is all those who have been made a credible profession of faith, been baptized, and been accepted by the session for membership; the latter comprises the children of communicant members.</p>
<p>Within these, individual congregations may specify further distinctions through their bylaws; for example, commonly a church will restrict voting to communicant members over the age of 18. Or, churches may provide for associate members who have all the privileges of full members except for voting.</p>

</h2>
<p>As the clerk is charged with keeping the rolls and registers of the church, it falls to him to handle many membership processes. One such common process is the adding or removal of members to the rolls of the church. Particular steps will differ by individual church, but a good guideline for procedure is as follows:</p>

<h3>Sending letters<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sending-letters"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>

<p>To speed the process of sending letters in the above procedure, a clerk may wish to use templates for commonly sent letters such as inquiries about <a href="https://github.com/Evangel-Presbytery/clerks-handbook/files/8682841/Good.standing.pdf">good standing</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Evangel-Presbytery/clerks-handbook/files/8682848/Transfer.notification.letter.pdf">transfer letters</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Evangel-Presbytery/clerks-handbook/files/8682850/Membership.removal.for.non.attendance.template.pdf">dismissal letters</a>, [inquiries about membership status for members who relocate(<a href="https://github.com/Evangel-Presbytery/clerks-handbook/files/8682852/Member.relocated.attendance.inquiry.pdf" class="uri">https://github.com/Evangel-Presbytery/clerks-handbook/files/8682852/Member.relocated.attendance.inquiry.pdf</a>), or <a href="https://github.com/Evangel-Presbytery/clerks-handbook/files/8682853/Attendance.inquiry.pdf">exhortations toward church attendance</a>. ] corrections?” “There being no [further] corrections, the minutes stand approved [as corrected].” –See RONR 41:11.</p>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> Following the Agenda<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#following-the-agenda"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Members of the board generally have the privilege of introducing new items of business during the “New Business” section of a meeting (RONR 41:27). If there is an agenda that determines what business is in order for the meeting, that agenda must be approved by the board (typically at the beginning of the meeting) to be binding (RONR 41:61-62). The important thing here is you want to preserve the ability of a board member to bring up a topic (the voice of the minority).</p>
</div>
<div id="orders-of-the-day" class="section level3" number="4.2.2">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">4.2.2</span> Orders of the Day<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#orders-of-the-day"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Some boards have a standard ending time for their meetings. This is called “Orders of the day” (RONR 41:41). As clerk, don’t necessarily yell it out the minute you reach “orders of the day”. Be sensitive to the conversation that’s going on and bring it up at the earliest opportune moment.</p>
</div>
<div id="recording-motions" class="section level3" number="4.2.3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">4.2.3</span> Recording Motions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#recording-motions"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>As clerk you are responsible to record motions in the minutes. Sometimes it can be a challenge to know exactly what the motion is, as several people may have been contributing ideas. If your board is operating informally, the clerk must work to discern between what is simply brainstorming (that doesn’t need to be recorded) and what is a developing consensus decision on a matter. He must keep current on the changing text of the motion (typically this involves typing and editing on a laptop computer) so that when called upon to read the motion he may do so without delay.</p>
<p>Don’t become paralyzed if you are not sure what is in and what is out of the motion. You can speak up and ask for clarification if needed, but try not to do this too much as you don’t want to dominate the discussion. Generally you just need to make a judgment call as to what you believe the current motion is. When called upon to read the motion you will be corrected if there is disagreement over what’s being voted on.</p>
<p>If the moderator calls for the vote on a motion that has had significant discussion and you <em>haven’t</em> been asked to read the motion, interrupt before the vote to ask, “May I read the motion as I currently have it?” or a more particular “Did we end up proposing to send two of us or is just X being sent?”</p>
<p>If you apply yourself to this work you will learn your elder’s board and you’ll get better at these judgment calls.</p>
<div id="amended-motions" class="section level4" number="4.2.3.1">
<h4>
<span class="header-section-number">4.2.3.1</span> Amended Motions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#amended-motions"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>For motions that are amended, you almost never need to record the original version of the motion in the minutes. You just record the version you ended up with just before the final vote, and then if it is adopted you say, “Adopted as amended.” (RONR 48:4(6)(a); see 48:8 for an example.)</p>
<p>Occasionally the elders board may have a motion with an amendment (and possibly an amendment of the amendment) pending and the board decides that it no longer wants to deal with the main motion or its amendments. In this case a motion is in order to “postpone to a definite time” (say next elders’ meeting) or to “postpone indefinitely.” If such a motion is approved, it dismisses the previous main motion <em>and all of its pending amendments</em> with that one vote. In such a case, the minutes will need to record the current state of the motion and all pending amendments (RONR 48:4(6)(b). This is one of the only times you ever need to record the contents of amendments and other than the final version of a motion in the minutes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">4.2.4</span> Motion to Adjourn<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#motion-to-adjourn"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The moderator should generally ask for a motion to adjourn rather than simply adjourning the meeting on his own authority (see e.g. RONR 21:14-15). Asking for a motion to adjourn gives anyone who needs to a chance to bring up important business before the meeting is over. A motion to adjourn is not debatable or amendable - if the body doesn’t want to do it the motion simply gets voted down and you proceed with business.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">4.3.1</span> Small Boards<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#small-boards"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Robert’s Rules explicitly calls for less formality when the size of the board is small:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a board meeting where there are not more than about a dozen members present, some of the formality that is necessary in a large assembly would hinder business. The rules governing such meetings are different from the rules that hold in other assemblies, in the following repects… –RONR 49:21</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Motions do not need a second (though see below about custom)</li>
<li>Informally discussing subjects is allowable when there’s not a motion currently pending</li>
<li>The chairman can participate in debates and in informal discussions and can vote on matters (unless your bylaws specify that he doesn’t have a vote) – all without leaving the chair (i.e. without temporarily stepping down as moderator as you do in a large assembly)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is all addressed in RONR 49:21.</p>
</div>
<div id="custom" class="section level3" number="4.3.2">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">4.3.2</span> Custom<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#custom"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>It is not against Robert’s Rules for a board to have its own customs…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In some organizations, a particular practice may sometimes come to be followed as a matter of established custom so that it is treated practically as if it were prescribed by a rule. If there is no contrary provision in the parliamentary authority or written rules of the organization… –RONR 2:25</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, a small board might by custom require a second on formal motions. There may be no need to have this custom written down. You simply observe it.</p>
<p>When a custom is called into question, it may sometimes make sense to take a vote on it that’s then entered in the minutes and documented as a decision of the board.</p>

</h2>
<p>Congregational meetings are necessarily more formal than session meetings because they involve more people. Here are some things to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Who’s clerk?</strong>: Depending on your church bylaws, you may automatically be clerk of congregational meetings by virtue of being clerk of session; or a clerk may need to be elected. Know your bylaws and help the moderator know what is supposed to be done.</li>
<li>
<strong>What’s a quorum?</strong>: The clerk of the meeting will need to establish a quorum in order to conduct business at the meeting. Consult your church bylaws beforehand to know how many members constitute a quorum.</li>
<li>
<strong>Ballots</strong>: If your church bylaws call for voting by secret ballot, ensure that such ballots are prepared for the meeting.</li>
<li>
<strong>Minutes</strong>: The clerk is responsible for taking minutes of the congregational meeting.</li>
</ul>
